Diabetes Prediction Project
Project Overview
This project aims to predict whether a person has diabetes or not based on specific health metrics and medical data. Using a given dataset, the goal is to apply machine learning techniques to build a predictive model that can accurately classify individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic. This project showcases the application of data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, evaluation, and optimization in a healthcare context.

The motivation behind this project is to explore how Artificial Intelligence and Data Science can help in early detection and diagnosis, potentially reducing the risk and complications associated with diabetes. By leveraging machine learning, we aim to develop a tool that can assist healthcare professionals in making data-driven decisions.

Workflow
Data Collection and Understanding

The dataset used in this project contains features such as glucose levels, insulin, BMI, age, and other health metrics that may influence diabetes risk.
You can find the dataset at: [Link to dataset if public].
Data Preprocessing

Handle missing or incomplete data by either imputing missing values or removing invalid entries.
Normalize/Standardize the data to bring all features to a common scale.
Split the dataset into training and test sets to ensure robust model evaluation.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Conduct EDA to understand relationships between features and identify important predictors for diabetes.
Use visualization techniques such as heatmaps, histograms, and scatter plots to observe data distributions and correlations.
Feature Selection

Select the most relevant features based on EDA and correlation analysis to enhance model performance.
Remove any redundant or highly correlated features that do not add value to the prediction.
Model Selection

Several machine learning algorithms will be tested, including:
Logistic Regression
Random Forest Classifier
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Models are evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine the best performing model.
Model Training

Train the selected machine learning model(s) using the training dataset.
Perform hyperparameter tuning (e.g., using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV) to optimize the model's performance.
Model Evaluation

Evaluate the trained model using the test dataset.
Generate a confusion matrix, classification report, and ROC curve to assess the model's performance and ability to generalize to unseen data.
Deployment (Optional)

Package the model for deployment in a web application or an API for real-time predictions.
Integrate the model with user-friendly interfaces for healthcare professionals or patients to use the diabetes prediction tool.
